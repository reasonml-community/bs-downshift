## Usage

See [examples](./examples) folder.

### Usage of `render` function

The `render` prop is a function that passes an object which contains _methods_ and _values_.

In ReasonML, this object is represented as a module called `ControllerStateAndHelpers`.

To make use of the _methods_ and _values_ within that module, you need to call it by passing the argument type (which is of type `ControllerStateAndHelpers.t` and does effectively the binding to the JS object method) like:

```js
render=(
  t => {
    ControllerStateAndHelpers.toggleMenu(t, ());
    /* ... */
  }
)
```

You can see that in the [examples](./examples) folder.
